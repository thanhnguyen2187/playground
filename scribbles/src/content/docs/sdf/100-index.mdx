description: About the section "Software Design for Flexibility"

I put my thoughts and notes and answers to exercises of the book "Software
Design for Flexibility" [^sdf] here. I'll be adding more content as I read the
book. To run or check the exercises yourself, you'll need MIT Scheme installed
and the book's supporting code [^code].
