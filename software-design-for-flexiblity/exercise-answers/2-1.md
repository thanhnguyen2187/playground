# Exercise 2.1: Arity repair

The procedures *compose* and *parallel-combine* that we have introduced do not
obey the requirement that they advertise the arity of the combination. Thus they
would not be good citizens of our family of combinators. Fix the implementation
of *compose* and *parallel-combine* shown above, so that:

- they check their components to make sure that the arities are compatible;
- the combination they construct checks that it is given the correct number of
  arguments when it is called;
- the combination advertises its arity correctly for *get-arity*.

Environment setting up:

```scheme
(load "./sdf/manager/load")
(manage 'new-environment 'combinators)
```

Firstly, we should understand the requirements:

> The procedures *compose* and *parallel-combine* [...] do not obey the
> requirement that they advertise the arity of the combination.

```scheme
(define (compose f g)
  (lambda args
    (f (apply g args))))

(define (parallel-combine h f g)
  (define (the-combination . args)
    (h (apply f args)
       (apply g args)))
  the-combination)
```
Implementation:

```scheme

```

Testing:

```scheme
```
